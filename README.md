# Retrocide

  Made for the UQCS 2016 Hackathon

## Premise

  Retrocide is a game where the goal is to make a species go extinct.
  But instead of using conventional methods of killing all the organisms
  you kill certain ancestors which result in the extinction in 100 years.

  No RNG is used except for pseudo-random generation of the initial conditions.
  This means that if you use the same seed and kill the same organisms, the
  same result will occur everytime.

## Technical

  No hard-coding of events. This means no 'if all males die then species is
  extinct'.

  Chaos theory - Same algorithm applied over the network over iterations.
  Evolutionary algorithms - Each organism has 'DNA', its offspring's 'DNA' is
  determined by the parents'.

  Highly customizable, this allows to easily apply the base concepts to 
  other things. For example somebody could dedicate a lot of time to make it
  realistic for humans.

## Difficulties

  1. Intelligent organisms.
  2. ...
